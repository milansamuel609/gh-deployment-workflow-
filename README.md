# 🚀 GitHub Pages Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates how to use **GitHub Actions** to automatically deploy changes to **GitHub Pages** whenever the `index.html` file is updated.  

## 🌟 Features
- **Automatic Deployment**: Any changes made to `index.html` in the `main` branch trigger a deployment.  
- **GitHub Actions Workflow**: Uses a CI/CD pipeline for seamless automation.  
- **GitHub Pages Hosting**: The website is accessible via GitHub Pages.

## 📂 Project Structure

```sh
📁 my-project
│-- 📜 index.html # The main HTML file deployed to GitHub Pages
│-- 📜 README.md # Project documentation (this file)
└── 📁 .github
└── 📁 workflows
└── 📜 deploy.yml # GitHub Actions workflow for deployment
```

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Push changes to `main` branch`**
